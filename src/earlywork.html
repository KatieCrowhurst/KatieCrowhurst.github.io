                    <h1>Early Experimentation</h1>
                    <p class="intropara"> When I first started learning HTML and CSS, it was important to understand the key concepts. This lead to
                        a lot of experimentation, and a lot of simple pages being created. Here are some examples demonstrating my
                        learning. Once I was comfortable with creating various elements and simple navigation, I wanted to increase the functionality
                        on my pages.</p>
                    <div id="codingjournal">
                        <img id="journalimg" src="images/CodingJournal.png">
                        <p>Here is one of the first HTML pages I made. It includes a background image, list, a small form, several small divs with 
                            a shadow effect, and a footer included. Whilst quite plain and simple, it allowed me to learn how to create all of these 
                            elements, and position them in a readable way.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="bandpage">
                        <img id="bandpageimg" src="images/HtmlLearning.png">
                        <p>This page allowed me to experiment with colour as a background for text, insert paragraphs of text, use borders, remove list styling, 
                            and add in custom fonts. I added functionality to my list this time so a user could navigate to a separate page using a relative link 
                            set in my HTML.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h1>Learning JavaScript</h1>
                    <p class="intropara"> I taught myself JavaScript through Udemy videos in my spare time after work. The course I took included theory, as well
                        as practical projects to help solidify my learning. You can see some of the work I completed as part of this course below.</p>
                    <h1>Dice Game</h1>
                    <div id="dicegame">
                        <img id="dicegameimg" src="images/DiceGame.png">
                        <p>The first practical project on the course was a dice game. Players could input a target number to reach and players would take turns to roll
                            the dice. The game was based on the dice game "Pig", and so had to incorporate certain rules, i.e. if a player rolls a one they lose all of 
                            their points accumulated for that round.<br>This was my first time using JavaScript and I learned how to use event listeners (to listen for 
                            the click event on the roll/hold buttons), how to use if statements (to put in place the rules, and to identify if the target score had been met),
                            and some of JavaScript's math functions (Math.random to generate a random number).</p>
                    </div>
                    <h1>Budget Calculator</h1>
                    <div id="calculator">
                        <video id="budgetyvideo" width="600" height="400" controls>
                            <source src="videos/BudgetyDemo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                            Your browser does not support the video tag.
                        </video>
                        <p>The budget calculator app as you can see in this video, allows for user input. A user can add their monthly income/expenses and the app will
                            display these in two separate lists. The app will also work out what percentage each expense is of the total income.<br> In this project I was
                            introduced to the concept of controllers to separate and order my code, shown how to use and manipulate lists, had to carry out more
                            mathematical equations (to work out the percentages), and how to interact with my HTML elements (for example how to update my UI 
                            elements smoothly with each new addition/subtraction/percentage change).
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h1>Forkify App</h1>
                    <div id="forkify">
                        <img id="forkifyimg" src="images/Forkify.png">
                        <p>The Forkify app was my first time interacting with an API. A user is able to search for a food item, and the app will return a list of related
                            recipes. The user can then view the recipe, and even add the ingredients to a shopping list.<br> I split my code into separate views and models so
                            that I could keep related code/functions together, to make it easier to understand. Prior to this the other projects had been using JavaScript version
                            ES5, but this project allowed me to explore version ES6.<br> This was also the first time I had been introduced to async/await. To handle loading of
                            recipes in the UI once a search query had been initiated, I was able to render a loading spinner to visually indicate to a user that their request
                            is currently being handled.</p>
