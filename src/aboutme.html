            <div class="introduction">
                <p>Hi I'm Katie! I am based in Kent, and I am currently employed as a Junior Developer. I graduated <br> with a Distinction in my MSc Computer Science in 2019, and
                    I spend a lot of my time trying to learn <br> new things that will support my development career.</p>
                <p>I am a well-organised and motivated person, with a strong interest in Front-End development. <br> I love wireframing prototypes, creatively solving issues
                     and giving life to my designs. However, <br> in the future I would love to secure a Full-Stack Developer role to enable me to fully design systems <br> from
                     start to finish - being involved in every step of the process. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding I enjoy gaming, reading and spending time exercising outdoors with my mother. <br> There's always time for a good TV series too!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current skillset: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, Java, Git, Prolog, jQuery, C#
                </p>
