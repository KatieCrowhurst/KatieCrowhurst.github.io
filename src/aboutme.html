            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! This website is designed to showcase the projects and work 
                that have kept me busy and allowed me to develop the skillset that I have today. Please feel free to take a look!</p>
            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Katie Crowhurst and I currently work as a Junior Developer for Integrated Care 24 (IC24).</p>
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My journey to get to where I am today has most definitely been interesting. I actually come from a Child Psychology 
                background – I studied a Childcare Diploma at college and went on to complete a Bachelor’s degree in Childhood and 
                Youth Studies with Psychology. Unfortunately this was the first year that the university were running this course, 
                and during my final year of study, we were told that they had not succeeded in getting accreditation from the British 
                Psychological Society (BPS) for the course like they had hoped. I had hoped to pursue a career as an Educational Psychologist, 
                but this news meant that the journey would be a lot tougher, and in the end, something that financially I would not be able to afford.</p>
            <p>After moving back home with my parents and working in roles where I was unfortunately able to progress, I started heavily 
                researching into new career sectors that I could venture into. I wanted a role that was challenging, exciting - something 
                completely new where I could really succeed. My partner was a Network Engineer at the time, studying for Cisco certifications, and on 
                weekends when I would visit him we would watch some of the course content together. This, and his support, encouraged me to delve into 
                the IT sector, where I discovered I was extremely interested in web development.<br> It was new, exciting, challenging, with a huge 
                variety of learning experiences and paths to follow, and actually very rewarding. I love the feeling of building something up from scratch!</p>

            <h2>My Learning</h2>
            <p>I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the basics of MySQL over roughly a year and a half. In the early stages of my learning I created a 
                basic Coding Journal website which gave me a clear understanding of HTML and CSS. I also started to create a basic “About Me” website, which 
                has now been re-purposed in the building of this website.<br>Once I felt comfortable with HTML and CSS, I took a Udemy course to learn JavaScript. 
                The course combined theory and practical projects, and really allowed me to become confident in using JavaScript. I was able to manipulate my HTML 
                elements, create event handlers and provide interactivity in my pages.</p>

                my pages.</p>
            <p>We were challenged through practical assessments – a lot of which are detailed in the Projects section of this website. My confidence with HTML, CSS 
                and JavaScript increased when creating a Theatre Booking website, and my IBD application for my dissertation project. Particularly in my dissertation 
                project I was able to interact with my database from my HTML, which I’d never done before. I became comfortable with creating and querying databases, 
                and accessing them on my webpages through PHP Data Objects (PDO). I was introduced to Object Oriented Programming through learning Java. I was also 
                introduced to logic programming and the declarative programming language Prolog – which I must admit I wasn’t so keen on!</p>
            <p>However the course did not only boost my confidence in using various different languages. I also learned the process of becoming a developer. I learned 
                the process of requirements gathering, the importance of design in building software, how to demonstrate a product’s behaviour prior to development 
                through wireframes, using UML diagrams to show system processes, the importance of testing, and collaboration with others using GitHub.</p>
            <p>For more information on the work I have done, please feel free to browse my work on the Projects page of this website.</p>
